"""
Designed to track crest, foot, and dwend points of dunes from 120122AA time
lapse footage, where dunes are seen in profile and there is no scale known.
Data is input in a .csv file with three lines per dune in a step. Dune class
is borrowed from Kelly's code.

class Dune:
    """
    This is a class which holds information about a snow dune.
    Each dune is described by three points: one on the crest, one on the foot,
    and one on the dwend.
    These points are defined for each point in time as the dune moves
    across Niwot Ridge.

    To use:
    #Create a dune:
    >> new_dune = Dune(name)
    # Put points in the dune using command
    >> new_dune.add_position(step, (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3))
    # Collect points into dataframe
    >> new_dune.finalize()
    # Do some analysis,
    #  e.g. plot position of dune crest against step number:
    >> plt.plot(new_dune['Step'], new_dune['Top'])
